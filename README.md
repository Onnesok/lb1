# lb1

Welcome to lb1 — a small, friendly starter repository. This README gives a quick overview, usage hints, and guidance for contributing so you (or your classmates) can get up and running fast.

## What is this project?

`lb1` is a minimal repository intended as a playground or lab starter. Use it to store exercises, experiment with code, or as a scaffold for small assignments.

## Highlights

- Clean, minimal structure — easy to adapt for coursework or demos.
- Lightweight and framework-agnostic.
- Ready for documentation, tests, and quick iteration.

## Quick start (Windows)

1. Open a command prompt.

```cmd
cd C:\path\to\your\projects
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd lb1
```

2. Open the folder in your editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code) and start editing files.

## Suggested structure

- `README.md` — this file
- `src/` — source files (create if needed)
- `tests/` — tests and examples

You can adapt the structure to match the language or framework you choose.

## How to use this repo

- Add your code inside `src/` and keep tests in `tests/`.
- Document important behaviors and usage examples in this README.
- Commit often and use clear commit messages.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. If you're using this for a class assignment, follow your instructor's rules for submissions. Otherwise:

1. Fork the repo (if published remotely).
2. Create a feature branch.
3. Open a pull request with a description of your changes.

## License

This project does not include a license by default — add one if you plan to publish or share it broadly. A common choice is the MIT license.
